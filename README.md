# VueFast 

This is the repository for the article [Quick Containerized Web Apps with Vue.js, FastAPI, and OpenAPI](https://brmartin.com/web-app-vuejs-fastapi-openapi-and-docker/). 

The code here defines a boilerplate setup for connecting Vue.js and FastAPI via OpenAPI generated code. 

Feel free to learn from it and use it as a starting point for your own projects.
